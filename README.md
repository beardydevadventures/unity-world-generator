# Unity World Generator

## Overview

This project is focused on creating terrain generation within Unity using Perlin Noise. The terrain generation system is designed to dynamically produce varied landscapes that can include features like mountains, plains, forests, and bodies of water. This is particularly useful for games and simulations requiring dynamic environments.

## Features

- **Procedural Terrain Generation**: Generates terrain dynamically based on Perlin noise and other algorithms to create realistic landscapes.
- **Biome System**: Implements a biome system that adjusts terrain features and vegetation based on environmental factors.
- **Detail Placement**: Automatically places details like rocks and vegetation according to terrain characteristics and biome types.
- **Dynamic Object Placement**: Supports the placement of dynamic objects within the terrain that respond to terrain contours and biome specifics.

## Usage

To get started with this project:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in Unity (recommended version: Unity 2020.3 LTS or later).
3. Load the main scene and press Play to see the terrain generation in action.

## Reference

This project was inspired by techniques covered in [Red Blob Games' article on terrain generation from noise](https://www.redblobgames.com/maps/terrain-from-noise/). The concepts from the article were adapted and expanded upon to fit the specific needs of real-time terrain generation in Unity.
